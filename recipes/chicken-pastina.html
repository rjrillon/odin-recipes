    <p>
      Chef John's chicken pastina is like a big, warm hug from an Italian grandma, a comfort food
      that will, quite literally, change your mood. You can make this simple soup with a fortified
      broth if you have the time, or simply use off-the-shelf chicken broth for the 15-minute
      version.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups prepared chicken broth</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup star-shaped pastina, or acini di pepe</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring broth to a simmer over medium-high heat. Taste; season with salt if needed.</li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium, and stir in pastina. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30
        seconds less than the package directions, 5 to 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off heat, and stir in black pepper, butter, and some of the grated cheese. Stir
        constantly until butter disappears.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle pastina into hot bowls. Top with more freshly ground black pepper and remaining
        Parmigiano Reggiano; drizzle with olive oil and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
